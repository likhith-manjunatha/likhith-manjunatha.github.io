.. topic:: About me


    | I am an ex- marine food processor, seaport truck loader, rice cake processor, dish washer, tomato harvester, English teacher, bamboo trimmer, and a tangerine farm-hand; friend to fishermen, rice farmers, and a Buddhist monk; neighbour to sashimi chef and Yakuza. My professional interest and standing today as a scientist is but a result of the collective influence of these rare experiences and chance encounters. Although I have gathered much experience in molecular dynamics simulations, heat transfer, machine learning and automation, my academic pursuits have finally led me to research on automotive hydrogen fuel cells. It is inevitable that hydrogen based energy systems will occupy a strong place in future society. For now, improving current fuel cell durability while also driving down costs remains to be the last great obstacle before widespread adoption and commercialization.
